# better-chat-cord

### Did you ever think that Discord is changing for the worse? <br>
### Are you fed up with your chat message field being blocked by a million buttons, that you don't even use?

Then this theme is just what you were looking for!

## How does this work?

You'll have to download [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) (a third party Discord client mod). <br>
Yes, this is technically against [ToS](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxAL20q1GccJvpDi07ZAi0_eRFFFoJWDV5?si=nIiSc9oxnAD4peG-), I am not encouraging you do, but otherwise you won't be doing much with this. <br>
Here is [No Text To Speech's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_pAg_gV6Kw) on Vencord.


## What does this do?

On it's own? Nothing. <br>
It makes things Discord think are important invisible. <br>
Things you can hide:
- Library tab
- Nitro tab
- Shop tab (default)
- Chat gift button (default)
- Gif picker
- Sticker picker (default)
- Emoji picker
- Apps button (default)

If you just want to hide what I'm hiding (Shop, Nitro gifting, Sticker button, Apps button) then you can just use this link: <br>
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xenoreaper/better-chat-cord/refs/heads/main/chat-box-2.css
```

## How do I use this theme?

1. Install [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/)
2. Go to settings > Vencord > Themes
3. Under Online themes paste the above link
4. profit

Or alternatively if my settings aren't restrictive enough you can also download the .css and uncomment what you want to hide.
